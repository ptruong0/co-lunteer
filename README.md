# Colunteer

This project was created for CalHack's hello:world hackathon April 2021.

Co-lunteer is a React web application that allows users to look for posted volunteering events near them and sign up for them. Users can also filter the event results by different categories of volunteering, such as environment or education. Organizers can create new events to post on the event feed, so that potential volunteers can sign up for their events.
